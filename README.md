# HYBRID-VISION-TRANSFORMER-APPROACH-TO-STRENGHTEN-SIGNATURE-VERIFICATION
A Deep Learning model that actively generates and modifies data for improved handwritten signature verification. It uses a variation consistency mechanism with a discriminator, extractor, and verifier trained adversarially. Tested on four signature datasets, including Synthetic Signature, achieving high accuracy. ðŸš€
